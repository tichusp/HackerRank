The problem.

Alex is preparing for a programming contest and decides the gears turning in his head are at war with his own laziness.
He imagines chains of n circularly linked gears trying to turn in his head, and wonders under which circumstances they might be
able to turn together in a single chain and when they might be locked (i.e., unable to rotate together).

Alex decides to set a problem for himself by creating q queries where each query takes the form of an integer, n, denoting some number
of circularly linked gears. For each query, print Yes on a new line if the gears can turn together; otherwise, print No.

Input Format

The first line contains single integer, q, denoting the number of queries. Each line i of the q subsequent lines contains a single integer, n,
denoting the number of gears for that query.

Constraints

1 <= q <= 10^5
3 <= n <= 10^5

Output Format

For each query, print Yes on a new line if it is possible to rotate all  gears simultaneously; otherwise, print No.

The solution.

function processData(input) {
    input = input.split('\n').slice(1);
    for (var i = 0, len = input.length; i < len; i++) {
        console.log(input[i] % 2 ? 'No' : 'Yes');
    }
}

process.stdin.resume();
process.stdin.setEncoding("ascii");
_input = "";
process.stdin.on("data", function (input) {
    _input += input;
});

process.stdin.on("end", function () {
   processData(_input);
});
